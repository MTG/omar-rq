# Why is this folder containing a lobster?

Our model is named **Omar**, a simple and memorable name. Interestingly, in several languages such as **Danish, Norwegian, Russian, Ukrainian, Bulgarian, Serbian, Rumanian (with h), and Croatian**, the word *omar* means **lobster**. In **Esperanto**, the equivalent is *omaro*. We found these coincidences wonderful and decided to include a picture of a lobster in the repository as a playful reference to the model’s name.  
Note: in **Turkish**, *omar* does **not** mean lobster — the correct word there is *ıstakoz*.
